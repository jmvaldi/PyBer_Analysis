## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city types (cities, suburban, and rural). Then using knowledge of Pandas and Matplotlib a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares of each city type is plotted. Before this deliverable was made, data for PyBer's operation was aggragated to give data for each city type for: ride count, average fare per ride, average number of drivers.
## Results
A ride-sharing summary DataFrame was created (see below), we can see from the columns of "Total Drivers" there's more riders in the more populated city types that are urban compared to rural city types this correlates with the employment demand of drivers for each city type respectively. Average fare for urban city types are accordingly more than the other two city types because of the demand from metroplitan settings. Sinces there is less drivers in rural areas compared to urban areas, then there will be a higher average fare per ride-share and driver respectively. The high demand for PyBer ride-share in urban areas drops the price for fares compared to the suburban areas

## Summary
Looking at the line data that plots all three different city types for the months of January through April we can see that there are some disparities. For PyBer ride-share some take aways from the chart show that fare per ride for rural users is on average $10.00 more than the urban fare. This big difference can discourage potential ride-share users specially if they are aware or even commute from the urban city to the rural cities. A spike in total fares can be seen accross the board for urban, suburban, and rural city types during the end of February. Further research as to why this occurs could be favorable for the company to capitalize on. Since most of the revenue comes from urban areas it is important to highlight and research the dips that happen in the month of March. Unlike rural and suburban cities there is an immediate dip in revenue coming at the start of the year for rural cities, something to look into. There seesm to be less incentivesfor people to seek driver jobs in the rural areas because of the scarcity of ride-share users when looking at the Total Fares column.
